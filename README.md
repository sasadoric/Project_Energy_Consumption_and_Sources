# Project_Energy_Consumption_and_Sources

-Cleaning data with "SQLQuery_Data_CLeaning_Energy_Consumption_Table"  raw data  , that were all in one columns (as can be seen in energy_ raw_data), were sorted into 4 columns as can be seen in .PNG file

-Exploring data in "SQLQuery1":
1.Table "renewable-share-energy.xlsx" and table "Energy Consumption without continents.xlsx" were joined on Country(Entity) to explore Energy consumption and percent of energy from renewable sources per Country

Dashboard is available on my profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sasa3095  with:
Two Bar charts and one Line chart - showing sources of energy for biggest countries in the world: USA, China, India, Germany, Russia and Japan in years 1970 and 2021, as well as changing of total energy consumption per year for period from 1970 to 2021(data for Russia in 1970 was not given, because back then it was part of Soviet Union).
